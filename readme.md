# Binary Particle Swarm Optimization

this is a python implementation of BPSO for Association Rule Mining

## Parameters

the algorithm takes the following parameters :

- max_iter : the max number of iteration for the algorithm to stop
- particle_number: the number of particles in a population
- M : the number of AS that we wont to get at the end of the algorithm




## preprocessing

the Jupyter notebook contains the preprocessing of the file `dataset.txt` to `market.csv`
